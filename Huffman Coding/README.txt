Project Explanation: In Project #2 for CSC 172, we had to write a code in a given file, HuffmanSubmit.java, which encodes and decodes files using Huffman coding. The source file I have submitted utilizes the given files, which are the other source files and the two example files, ur.jpg and alice30.txt. The program can be run once all the given files are downloaded and the source code should run perfectly. The decoded versions of the two examplen files perfectly match their respective original files. Since I utilized Eclipse as my IDE, to run the program, add the other src files to the same project and place the example files in the bin of the project, and then open the src file HuffmanSubmit on Eclipse and press the green arrow to run the program.
